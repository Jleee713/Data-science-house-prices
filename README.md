## Summary:

This project uses multiple datasets that consists of different demographic, age and socio-economic factors that would affect house prices in any region. For this particular problem, we are looking at areas that are divided up into local government areas (LGAs) of Sydney, however with the availability of more data, the analysis can be expanded across a larger scale. As the limitation of data does affect the reliability aspect of this analysis, it serves as a good template for predicting house prices using other datasets of demographic factors. 

We have used many different data visualization techniques to deliver certain analysis, trends and calculations in more readable way to others that do not have data science knowledge. The target audience for this project analysis is for anyone that is interested in purchasing houses in Sydney in the future years or generally curious which demographic factors have the most impact on the increase and decrease of house prices in a particular area.  

```3 data files are included:``` 
NSW quarterly house sales sorted by LGA from 2018-2019 retrieved from NSW Communities & Justiced Sales Reports, Socio-Economic Index for Areas (SEIFA) 2016 for NSW LGAs retrieved from ABS and Estimated Resident Population (ERP) from 2001-2020 retrieved from ABS. Three predictive models are included in the ipynb: simple linear regression, multiple linear regression and random forest regression. These models are tested and calucalte predictions of house prices in Sydney and compared with each other for a evaluation of such machine learning techniques.
